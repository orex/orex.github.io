This is a major release with several significant changes:\n Performance boost: Almost half of the code was changed in the release to achieve a performance improvement. Algorithms for symmetry search, electrostatic calculation, file I/O and, of course, structures enumeration became 4-10 times faster then previously. Multi threading: Enumeration algorithm can run in parallel on shared memory architectures. No extra programs (like MPI) are needed. In this release, you can gain from parallelization on up to 16 cores. The limit will be overcome with next release. Additional scenarios: Supercell program can be used now for searching of high symmetry disorder supercell (-n w option). Randomness of output structures can be controlled by random-seed option. New I/O module: Supercell program doesn\u0026rsquo;t use OpenBabel library for I/O and structures processing anymore. Reading and writing of CIF files now is done internally (thanks to gemmi library for cif parsing and spacegroup information). Such approach allows to increase performance and treat ambiguous spacegroup information and inconsistency in CIF files much better. New C++ standard: Supercell code were updated to C++14 standard. Support for old compilers has been dropped. Dependency update: Supercell v1.x code binaries (from the site) can be run successfully on Linux distribution from 2008 year up to now and support all x86_64 processors younger than year 2005. New version is compiled with relatively recent compilers and does not support obsolete Linux. It supports, for example: Ubuntu 14.04 and newer; Debian 8 and newer; CentOS 7 and newer etc. The CPU should be SSE2 compatible. Windows version improvement: Performance of Windows version is significantly improved by using modern build chains. Archive output (-a) is also supported now.  Old version (v1.2) binaries are available here. Note that this version is no longer supported.\n"},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell-new/docs/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial","description":"","content":"Download tutorial in PDF format\n"},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell-new/download/","title":"Download and install","description":"","content":"Compiled binaries The easiest way to obtain the program is to download compiled binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows platforms.

Table of Contents  Synopsis  Description  Options  Files  Examples  Requirements  Bugs and limitations  Version  Version history  License and Copyright  Author    Synopsis    supercell -h, --help    supercell [OPTIONS] -i input-file    supercell [OPTIONS] --input=input-file     Description Disordered compounds are very important now for fundamental science and industrial applications, but most of the methods of exploring solid state material properties require ideal periodicity. In opposition on many reported research, which imply periodicity to disordered system ``by hand'' and ad-hoc the program supercell allows to apply the approximation systematically with all-in-one algorithms implemented for structure manipulation, supercell generation, permutations of atoms and vacancies, charge-balancing, detecting symmetry equivalent structures, Coulomb energy calculations and sampling output data. The advantages of the program are fast-algorithms implementation and availability under GPL license.  Options  [-h], [--help]   Print help message and exit the program.   [-v level], [--verbose=level]   Change verbosity level from default 1. Level 0 - quiet mode, only error output. Level 1 is suggested for regular users. Higher levels are suggested for developers, bug tracking and long program execution times.   -i input-file, --input=input-file   Required option. Input file in CIF format. Only one file can be specified.   [-d], [--dry-run]   The option is highly recommended for the first run of the program with new input specified. With the option the program will do everything but write the files. Be careful if you switched -m, --merge-symmetric option: the program will go through all crystal structures, so even the dry-run mode can take time.   [-s cell-size], [--cell-size=cell-size]   The option specifies the size of the supercell. The format is AxBxC, where A, B, C are positive integer multipliers of a, b and c unit cell vectors of input system. Default is \"1x1x1\".   [-c balance-type], [--charge-balance=balance-type]   The option helps to balance charges of the structure. Be careful, charge balancing with wrong input charges will make output system composition far from desired or it can even freeze the program. Charges (i.e. oxydation states) may be specified with the -p, --labels-properties option (see below) or directly in the CIF file (\"_atom_type_oxidation_number\"). The possible arguments are: no  No charge balancing. The option will set all charges to zero.  try  Default. Try to charge balance system, if initial system is not charged.  yes  Charge balance the system.     [-p labels-properties], [--property=labels-properties]   The option will allow you to manually specify some properties of atoms with specific labels. You may use the simple or the extended syntax: Simple: \u0026lt;label\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;property_name\u0026gt;[=\u0026lt;property_value\u0026gt;].  Extended: \"\u0026lt;OPT\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;labels\u0026gt;):{\u0026lt;properties\u0026gt;}\" (Do not forget to put extended syntax in quotes).   where \u0026lt;label\u0026gt; is the label of the crystallographic site, the properties of which you want to change. \u0026lt;labels\u0026gt; is a set of space-separated labels. \u0026lt;OPT\u0026gt; is the type of string processing which is used to set the labels. The possible values of \u0026lt;OPT\u0026gt; are: p  Treat the labels in parenthesis like a plain string.  w, \"\"  Default for simple syntax. Treat the labels in parenthesis like a wild card. For example, N* means all labels, starting with N: N1, N12, but also Na3. You can use ``*'' (any numbers of any symbol) and ``?'' (any symbol: exactly one).  r  Treat the labels in parenthesis like a Perl Regex. Syntax description can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression.   The \u0026lt;property_name\u0026gt; is the name of the property you want to set for all specified crystallographic sites. Some properties can have values, which should be set by using an equal symbol. The properties can be: c[harge]  Set the charge of atoms with specified label(s). Floating-point value in elementary charge units.  p[opulation]  Number of atoms with specific label(s) in output supercell structure.  [not]fixed  Exclude crystallographic sites from the combinatorial analysis. The output supercell file will contain partial occupancies for the corresponding sites (if there were partial occupancies in the original structures).   Some fancy examples can be found below.   [-t tolerance], [--tolerance=tolerance]   The argument of the option specifies the maximum distance (in Angstroms) between sites that should be contained within the same group (meaning that the corresponding positions in the supercell cannot be occupied simultaneously). Check carefully the minimal distance between 2 atoms assigned to different groups, which is written in the output of supercell before changing this parameter. Default tolerance=0.75 A.   [-m], [--merge-symmetric]   The option enables the symmetry check algorithm on output structures. Structures that can be transformed to each other using crystallographic symmetry operations will be merged and stored as one structure. For cases with more than 10^4 total combinations it is recommended to use verbosity level 2 or higher to trace program execution.   [-n selection], [--store-structures=selection]   The option allows you to generate subsets of structures (rather than all) according to certain criteria (listed below). The option is very useful to both save disk space and facilitate navigation among files for large numbers combinations (typically more than 10^5).The argument of the option has special structure \u0026lt;sampling typer : select \u0026lt;count\u0026gt; random structures.  f : select \u0026lt;count\u0026gt; first structures.  a : select \u0026lt;count\u0026gt; last structures.  l : select \u0026lt;count\u0026gt; low energy structures (--coulomb-energy option required).  h : select \u0026lt;count\u0026gt; high energy structures (--coulomb-energy option required).   Example: l100 will store first 100 structures with low Coulomb energy.  Another extra option available to find symmetric structures: w : selects all structures with multiplicity (weight) less or equal \u0026lt;multiplicity\u0026gt;.   Example: w32 will store all structures with multiplicity, for example 32, 24, 16, 8, 1, but skip structures with multiplicity 48.  Multiple declaration of the option is allowed. If the option is enabled, an extra prefix (the letter \u0026lt;sampling type\u0026gt; will be added to output file name. Be careful, enabling the option requires extra memory, proportionally to the number of structures to store. This is specially important for ``w'' option.   [-q], [--coulomb-energy]   The option enable Coulomb energy calculations. The result energies for each structure are stored in file \u0026lt;output-prefix\u0026gt;_coulomb_energy.txt. The energies can help to consider the relevant regular structures for following calculations. Ewald summation algorithm is used for the calculations. Be careful, in case of charged cell the energy values can be meanless. See also --charge-balance option.   [-g], [--coulomb-store]   Use the option to create a file with electrostatic energy for all processed structures.   [-o output-prefix], [--output-prefix=output-prefix]   The options specify output file name prefix. The prefix can contain folder name but the folder should be created before run the program. For example, --output-prefix=myfolder/myfiles. The output files will be created according to templates. For non merging run the template will be \u0026lt;output-prefix\u0026gt;_i\u0026lt;sampling type--coulomb-energy option enabled.   [--random-seed=number]   The option specifies a random seed for structures random sampling.   [-a archive-file], [--archive=archive-file]   The option specifies a target archive file name for the output files, except energy file for all permuted configurations. If archive-file string is empty (default) no packing will be performed and all files will be stored directly to disk. If the file with the already name exists it will be overwritten. This optional feature requires libarchive http://www.libarchive.org/ to be available in the system. Otherwise the option will be disabled. Check the status by -h option. The extension of the file should be set according to desired archive type: ``.zip'', ``.tar'', ``.tgz'', ``.tar.gz'', ``.tar.bz2'', ``.tar.xz''.     Files  Examples The examples are based on file supercell/data/examples/Ca2Al2SiO7.  Dry run. Obtain information about the structure: group assignment, cell size, etc. It is a good practice to start a new structure processing with this command. This run doesn't produce any output files.  \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;supercell -d -i Ca2Al2SiO7.cif     Dry run.

Requirements Compiled version of supercell from site https://orex.github.io/supercell is standard alone program for both Linux and MacOS systems, which requires neither installation nor third-party libraries to install. Please check supercell/INSTALL file, if you would like to compile program by yourself.  Bugs and limitations  Supercell size limitation.  The maximum number of permutations should not exceed limit of 10^{16}. If more, the program will return an error. The value is far beyond a reasonable limit due to calculation time. The average program performance is about 10^{12}--10^{13} structures per day with average workstation.  Filesystem limitation.  Although, supercell can produce millions of files, most of the filesystems can't manage more than one thousand files in one folder with acceptable performance. Be careful, if you need to process a lot of combinations, sample them or use -a option.  Symmetry information handling in input file.  Be careful with low symmetric structures. For example, in monoclinic cells structures often have an inconsistency beetwen symmetry operations atoms positions and unit cell configuration. Supercell program does the best to solve the problems, but it is always a good idea to verify CIF file with external tools like enCIFer. The problem can be fully solved by converting input file to P1 structure (see non-diagonal supercell expansion).  Non-diagonal supercell expansion.  The program has it's own general algorithm for symmetry search. Input structures are converted internally to P1 structures and builtin algorithms search for symmetry in P1 structures. It gives a huge freedom for user, manipulating the input structure. For example, although, supercell cannot generate non-diagonal supercells directly, it can use such cells, generated with other software. You need to generate any cell and store it as P1 cell. Supercell is fully compatible with VESTA (highly recommended to use) output CIF files, but it is not compatible with Material studio output for example.    Version  Version: 2.0 of 2019/05/23.

But the method mostly applies to some particular cases, like low amount of impurity (one per supercell) or random disorder with special quasirandom structure (SQS) approximation2, because the number of derivative structures is one in these cases. In general, the number of derivative structures is high enough to be generated \u0026ldquo;by hand\u0026rdquo;. A few programs exist, which can help to generate derivative structures (see review). We believe that supercell program is one of the best choice, because the software was created to solve most of the technical problems of supercell approximation. The program includes algorithms for structure manipulation, supercell generation, permutations of atoms and vacancies, charge balancing, detecting symmetry-equivalent structures, electrostatic energy calculations and sampling output derivative structures. The software works with CIF files, therefore it is compatible with most of DFT software ( VASP, CASTEP, Wien2k etc). It has a powerful command line interface and works out-of-box on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms. The correctness of the program were verified by available literature data. The documentation includes open access paper, program interface manual, tutorial and variety of examples.\n  Buerger, M. J. (1947). J. Chem.

Surprisingly slower performance of \u0026ldquo;native\u0026rdquo; binaries with 8 cores can be most probably explained by previous version of TBB library from Ubuntu repository, which was used for compiling the code.\nRecommendations Some recommendation for optimal supercell performance:\n Use Linux. Prefer to run supercell on modern Workstation/Desktop rather than on old HPC. The example above is a \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; example which is used to compare different enumeration approaches. It does not include practical aspects like sampling. Please, use more real-world scenarios to check supercell code performance. For example supercell -i data/examples/CaAl6Te10/CaAl6Te10.cif -m -q -n r10 -n l10 -v 2 run includes electrostatic calculation and random sampling, which is needed in almost all practical cases. During this run 1011 structures process in 137 and 28 minutes on 1 and 8 threads respectively on Intel® Xeon® Gold 6226R 2.90GHz CPU. For regular users binaries are a preferable option. Now, with drop of old platforms support, they show a good performance. If you would like to install supercell on cluster, try to compile it by yourself with different compilers and options.

Most probably it can help you a lot if:\n You do some solid state calculations. Mostly DFT, but also MD or XRD analysis. You work with disordered materials: partial or/and mixed occupations structures. You have a very basic knowledge of CIF file structure and command line interface.  What are the benefits of supercell software compare to any other solutions?  All in one approach, instant start! You can work directly with CIF file within a few seconds. Powerful CLI with good verbosity. Electrostatic sampling method. Perfect performance. Integration with other software. A lot of useful examples in tutorial. Widely used by scientific community (more than 100 citations) in different materials.  But supercell program can’t work with non-diagonal supercells, can it? Should I use another code for the task? NO and NO. Supercell program can work with any supercells. Half of example supercell in the tutorial have a conventional cell, thus such structures are non-diagonal supercells of a primitive cell. Unique internal algorithms calculates symmetry operations using universal math approach, which does not rely on spacegroup information. But you can’t create a non-diagonal supercell with the program CLI. This is a conscious choice to leave program as simple as possible. Are you ready to write down “primitive to fcc” transformation matrix just by memory? I am not. If you would like to use non-diagonal supercells with supercell, create it with, for example, VESTA GUI ( video guide) or cif2cell CLI ( PDF) and use it in the program.\nI need to calculate the output structures in DFT code (VASP, CASTEP, Wien2k etc), but supercell produce cif files only…? Don’t worry! You can use excellent programs (link) like cif2cell, OpenBabel or AiiDA to convert output cif files to any other structures. And you can use the result in VASP, ABINIT, CPMD, CRYSTAL, Quantum espresso, Elk etc\nWhat should I do, if supercell code is not working? This is top one question. I wrote a special section with the same name in the tutorial.\nHow can I help supercell project? To be honest, nobody has ever asked me the question, but I would like to answer it so much, that I’ve decided to include it here. Now supercell is my hobby. Therefore, unfortunately, I don’t have much time to work with it. That’s why your help is very important for the project to stay alive. If you have anything valuable for other users, please share this. It can be, for example:\n well prepared bug report, of course. benchmark tests and performance suggestions. any input structures with description from your paper. I can put it to example folder. fair comparison with other similar programs. For example, share your story of switching to supercell from other program or vice versa. sharing your negative experience with supercell as well. It will help other users to avoid similar problems. anything else, that you think will be useful to share.
