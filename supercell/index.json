Feedback is very welcome.\n"},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell/version-2x/","title":"Whats new 2.x","description":"","content":"I\u0026rsquo;m proud to present you a new version of supercell program. This is a major release with several significant changes:\nPerformance boost: Almost half of the code was changed in the release to achieve performance improvement. Algorithms for symmetry search, electrostatic calculation, file I/O and, of course, structures enumeration became 4-10 times faster then previously. Multi threading: Enumeration algorithm can run in parallel on shared memory architectures. No extra programs (like MPI) are needed. In this release, you can gain from parallelization on up to 16 cores. The limit will be overcome with the next release. Additional scenarios: Supercell program can be used now for searching of high symmetry disorder supercell (-n w option). Randomness of output structures can be controlled by random-seed option. New I/O module: Supercell program doesn\u0026rsquo;t use OpenBabel library for I/O and structures processing anymore. Reading and writing of CIF files now is done internally (thanks to gemmi library for cif parsing and spacegroup information). Such approach allows to increase performance and treat ambiguous spacegroup information and inconsistency in CIF files much better. New C++ standard: Supercell code was updated to C++14 standard. Support for old compilers has been dropped. Dependency update: Supercell v1.x code binaries (from the site) can be run successfully on Linux distribution from 2008 year up to now and support all x86_64 processors younger than year 2005. New version is compiled with relatively recent compilers and does not support obsolete Linux. It supports for example: Ubuntu 14.04 and newer; Debian 8 and newer; CentOS 7 and newer etc. The CPU should be SSE2 compatible. Windows version improvement: Performance of Windows version is significantly improved by using modern build chains. Archive output (-a) is also supported now. Old version (v1.2) binaries are available here. Note that this version is no longer supported.\n"},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell/download/","title":"Download and install","description":"","content":"Compiled binaries The easiest way to obtain the program is to download compiled binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows platforms. Just download the archive, unpack it and follow the instruction inside. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to install the binaries, therefore you can use it without a root permission. The previous versions (v1.2 and v2.0.2 unsupported) of supercell is available in archive\nLinux x86_64 OSX Intel Windows x64\nPlease note that the Linux ARM64 architecture for this version is supported only via snap (see below). The support is in beta stage.\nSnap store (Linux) Another very modern option is to install program via snap. Available both for Intel/AMD and ARM (experimental) architectures.\nThis is available for almost all modern Linux distribution and is as easy as to click on the link above (Web UI) or to write the command in terminal:\nsudo snap install supercell Be careful, snap is a very secure way of installing programs. Therefore, you can get a permission error in case of running the program outside your home folder.\nRepository (ArchLinux) Old version of the program (v1.2) is available in ArchLinux repository.\nSource code You can also compile the program from source code. To do so, you should have knowledge of git and cmake. Please check github actions file supercell-cicd.yml for relevant commands. Please use latest version of OneAPI-tbb for the best performance. Compiling under Linux, OSX and FreeBSD should be relatively easy, but compiling on Windows should be done from scratch.\n"},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell/docs/","title":"Documentation","description":"","content":""},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell/docs/tutorial/","title":"Tutorial","description":"","content":"Download tutorial in PDF format\n"},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell/docs/manual/","title":"Manual","description":"","content":"Download manual in PDF format\n"},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell/faq/","title":"Mostly Asked Questions","description":"","content":"Does supercell program can help me in my research? Most probably it can help you a lot if:\nYou do some solid state calculations. Mostly DFT, but also MD or XRD analysis. You work with disordered materials: partial or/and mixed occupations structures. You have a very basic knowledge of CIF file structure and command line interface. What are the benefits of supercell software compare to any other solutions? All in one approach, instant start! You can work directly with CIF file within a few seconds. Powerful CLI with good verbosity. Electrostatic sampling method. Perfect performance. Integration with other software. A lot of useful examples in tutorial. Widely used by scientific community (more than 100 citations) in different materials. But supercell program can’t work with non-diagonal supercells, can it? Should I use another code for the task? NO and NO. Supercell program can work with any supercells. Half of example supercell in the tutorial have a conventional cell, thus such structures are non-diagonal supercells of a primitive cell. Unique internal algorithms calculates symmetry operations using universal mathematical approach, which does not rely on spacegroup information. It is true, that you can’t create a non-diagonal supercell with the program CLI. This is a conscious choice to leave program as simple as possible. Are you ready to write down “primitive to fcc” transformation matrix just by memory? I am not. If you would like to use non-diagonal supercells with supercell, create it with, for example, VESTA GUI ( video guide) or cif2cell CLI ( PDF) and use it in the program.\nI need to calculate the output structures in DFT code (VASP, CASTEP, Wien2k etc), but supercell produce cif files only…? Don’t worry! You can use excellent programs (link) like cif2cell, OpenBabel or AiiDA to convert output cif files to any other structures. And you can use the result in VASP, ABINIT, CPMD, CRYSTAL, Quantum espresso, Elk etc\nWhat should I do, if supercell code is not working? This is top one question. I wrote a special section with the same name in the tutorial.\nHow can I help supercell project? To be honest, nobody has ever asked me the question, but I would like to answer it so much, that I’ve decided to include it here. Now supercell is my hobby. Therefore, unfortunately, I don’t have much time to work with it. That’s why your help is very important for the project to stay alive. If you have anything valuable for other users, please share this. It can be, for example:\nwell prepared bug report, of course. benchmark tests and performance suggestions. any input structures with description from your paper. I can put it to example folder. fair comparison with other similar programs. For example, share your story of switching to supercell from other program or vice versa. sharing your negative experience with supercell as well. It will help other users to avoid similar problems. anything else, that you think will be useful to share.

In brief it can be summarized to:\nUse \u0026ldquo;good practices\u0026rdquo; when working with supercell program. Some of them are: Check carefully input and output. Be careful with spacegroups notations. Look through all the supporting materials: manual, tutorial, paper and examples. Work interactively. Try different input structures and parameters. Check program on provided examples. Troubleshoot problems by the algorithm provided. Look through existing issues. If you decide to write an issue on github, please be as verbose as possible. "},{"url":"https://orex.github.io/supercell/benchmark/","title":"Benchmark","description":"","content":"Results The benchmark which was published in the supercell paper (PbSnTe2 2x2x2) is obsolete. The current version of supercell program can process the configuration in a few seconds. More important that this test do nothing useful. Therefore below, I\u0026rsquo;ll use more advanced test case with 1011 total number of combinations, which does \u0026ldquo;wet-run\u0026rdquo; and generates output structures with random sampling and the lowest electrostatic energy. This is a real practical case of using of supercell program. The input file can be downloaded from supercell distribution CaAl6Te10.cif.\nTest command\nsupercell -i CaAl6Te10.cif -m -q -n r10 -n l10 -v 2 The tests were run ones for each of such configurations:\nIntel® Xeon® Gold 6226R 2.90GHz CPU (32 cores). Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Binary files from supercell site. During this run 1011 structures process in 117 and 6 minutes on 1 and 32 cores respectively. The maximum performance is around 300 mln structures per second.\nScalability Some test were performed to check scalability property of the program (see figure below). The y-axis shows performance per core normalized to performance v2.1 on one core. The extrapolation shows that even 64 cores can decrease processing time, because it is still higher than saturation limit.\nOptimal performance recommendations Use Linux. Other platforms binaries are not so well optimized as Linux binary. Optimal compiling of supercell program requires advanced programming skills, so binaries from the site is OK for most of the users. Supercell performance is very good correlated with benchmark scores from cpubenchmark.net. You can use the data to find optimal solution for running the program.

But the method applies mostly to some particular cases, like low amount of impurity (one per supercell) or random disorder with special quasirandom structure (SQS) approximation2, because the number of derivative structures is one in these cases. In general, the number of derivative structures is high enough to be generated \u0026ldquo;by hand\u0026rdquo;. There are some programs, which can help to generate derivative structures (see review). We believe that supercell program is the best choice, because the software was created to solve most of the technical problems of supercell approximation. The program includes algorithms for structure manipulation, supercell generation, permutations of atoms and vacancies, charge balancing, detecting symmetry-equivalent structures, electrostatic energy calculations and sampling output derivative structures. The software works with CIF files, therefore it is compatible with most of DFT software ( VASP, CASTEP, Wien2k etc). It has a powerful command line interface and works out-of-the-box on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms. The correctness of the program was verified by available literature data.
